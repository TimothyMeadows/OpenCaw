## When to use
Use when task planning begins or the TODO file is missing.

## Rules

- Put full work instructions in per-task TASK.md files
- Keep only open issue URLs in `../.ai/tasks/OPEN_ISSUES.md`
- Remove closed issue URLs via issue sync before active planning

## Command
../commands/update-todo-checklist.sh
